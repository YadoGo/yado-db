I had booked a cheap 5 day half board holiday in a family room sharing with my son and his 3 children (their first holiday abroad). We arrived in the morning all fit and well. Spent the day on the beach and a few hours in the pool. Our first meal was dinner. I suddenly felt nauseated at the sight of the buffets burger so I ate nothing and left. Throughout the night, I had stomach pains and non-stop vomiting for 12 hours than I starved myself and spent the 2nd day exhausted lying on the bed having my ears pounded by the entertainment noisy music. The cleaner came to do the room, and i expected it to be mopped, but basically, she just changed the towels and straightened the bed. I ended up buying wipes to clean the toilet sink and floor. One by one we all came down with it. When I was well enough i went to watch the evening entertainment and saw a child being sick. My son saw a review mentioning the sickness bug and he also spoke to another guest who said on her first day she had been sick. I had not eaten any food at the hotel so I either picked the bug up after being in the pool (it looks clean but didn't really smell of chlorine) the frequently used lifts (theirs only 2 with 5 floors) or maybe the room. I asked the receptionist if there was a sickness bug in the hotel, and he said no, but tbh they weren't interested in noting our illness. The hotel looks clean but the rooms are not mopped and the bed sheets were not changed. I can't rate the buffet because during my stay I have had toast melon water and the last two days cerals. I have been too unwell to risk a hot meal. The rest of my party said the breakfast was good but they didn't rate the hot food during the evening.
