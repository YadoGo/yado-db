In the dining room lifting dishes off the table before we had finished meals and wheeling trollies without regard for younger children. Overall we had a good week until Friday morning when my wife’s phone was lifted from our table at breakfast and stolen. It was immediately switched off and when we asked staff in dining room they were very unhelpful. Went to reception to be told to ask staff in dining room area. Eventually got to speak to the assistant manager at reception and police. He told us there is a gang from Barcelona who the police are monitoring and they were aware of someone connected to them having been in hotel that morning and being asked to be removed by security. I asked him how they got into the dining room as all guests are given a wrist band and they are stopped at entrance and asked to give their room number. He told me he didn’t know how they gained access to the dining area. This would raise big red flag for me as to how these peole managed to get in.

Spent the day on the beach and a few hours in the pool. Our first meal was dinner. I suddenly felt nauseated at the sight of the buffets burger so I ate nothing and left. Throughout the night, I had stomach pains and non-stop vomiting for 12 hours than I starved myself and spent the 2nd day exhausted lying on the bed having my ears pounded by the entertainment noisy music. The cleaner came to do the room, and i expected it to be mopped, but basically, she just changed the towels and straightened the bed. I ended up buying wipes to clean the toilet sink and floor. One by one we all came down with it. When I was well enough i went to watch the evening entertainment and saw a child being sick. My son saw a review mentioning the sickness bug and he also spoke to another guest who said on her first day she had been sick. I had not eaten any food at the hotel so I either picked the bug up after being in the pool (it looks clean but didn't really smell of chlorine) the frequently used lifts (theirs only 2 with 5 floors) or maybe the room. I asked the receptionist if there was a sickness bug in the hotel, and he said no, but tbh they weren't interested in noting our illness. The hotel looks clean but the rooms are not mopped and the bed sheets were not changed. I can't rate the buffet because during my stay I have had toast melon water and the last two days cerals.
