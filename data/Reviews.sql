So I mailed the hotel confused about only two guests, stating two children should be added and mentioning their birth dates. I got a reply that this was confirmed. But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer. The real and only contract was the bill they just had printed upon our arrival (which of course had no signature of me). They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me. You don't agree on something, confirm it, and then when the other party has done some effort to come to the closure of the agreement, you suddenly change the agreement leaving the other party no choice, considering the efforts already made.

We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.

Facilities within the building are also nice - free spa (don't forget to reserve it), game room with pool, PS2 (please upgrade it :) ), table football and darts. I couldn't manage to get some of those working and it's all pretty weared out, but for half an hour fun with kids it's good enough.

Also this blocks the doors to the balcony. It would be also very useful if the bedroom would have been physically closed from the rest of the apartment. In the current setup it's either everyone going to bed or no one. Also, maybe not directly related to apartment, the location is not very safely accessible by foot.

Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me.

I paid something around $250 a night thinking my long distance boyfriend and I would get a beautiful, comfortable room to enjoy, like in the photos. They mixed photos of the larger studios in with the small ones, from perspectives that did not show the whole room, so that you would be mislead to thinking you were getting a large room. In the hotel description it’s stated that each room, studio and one bedrooms, have a living room, not that they consist of ONLY a living room. Our space was so small, to open the dresser doors we had to move the beds, and then move them back to fit through the walkway when we were done. there wasn’t enough floor space for our two suitcases, so the kitchen table was reserved for that instead of eating. Lastly, the bed was two twin beds instead of a double, I know that’s someone common in Europe but don’t get any ideas that you and your partner will get to cuddle. The beds aren’t connected in any way and slide apart all night. On top of all that, the hotel has practically no amenities and the spa costs €12 per person for a 45 minute soak. When we complained about false advertising, the staff wasn’t able to get a manager on site and had to wait for one to call. We weren’t around for the call because they couldn’t give us any idea of when the manager might be available, so when we returned and they said they had called, they said the only option was to “upgrade” us to a slightly bigger room for over €400, and that no refund was possible.

I paid something around $250 a night thinking my long distance boyfriend and I would get a beautiful, comfortable room to enjoy, like in the photos. They mixed photos of the larger studios in with the small ones, from perspectives that did not show the whole room, so that you would be mislead to thinking you were getting a large room. In the hotel description it’s stated that each room, studio and one bedrooms, have a living room, not that they consist of ONLY a living room. Our space was so small, to open the dresser doors we had to move the beds, and then move them back to fit through the walkway when we were done. there wasn’t enough floor space for our two suitcases, so the kitchen table was reserved for that instead of eating. Lastly, the bed was two twin beds instead of a double, I know that’s someone common in Europe but don’t get any ideas that you and your partner will get to cuddle. The beds aren’t connected in any way and slide apart all night. On top of all that, the hotel has practically no amenities and the spa costs €12 per person for a 45 minute soak. When we complained about false advertising, the staff wasn’t able to get a manager on site and had to wait for one to call. We weren’t around for the call because they couldn’t give us any idea of when the manager might be available, so when we returned and they said they had called, they said the only option was to “upgrade” us to a slightly bigger room for over €400, and that no refund was possible.

I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.

But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer. The real and only contract was the bill they just had printed upon our arrival (which of course had no signature of me). They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me. You don't agree on something, confirm it, and then when the other party has done some effort to come to the closure of the agreement, you suddenly change the agreement leaving the other party no choice, considering the efforts already made.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

I booked this hotel via booking.com, searching for a room for two adults and two children, birth dates mentioned. The confirmation mail confirmed: two adults, two children, in total two guests. So I mailed the hotel confused about only two guests, stating two children should be added and mentioning their birth dates. I got a reply that this was confirmed. But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer. The real and only contract was the bill they just had printed upon our arrival (which of course had no signature of me). They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me. You don't agree on something, confirm it, and then when the other party has done some effort to come to the closure of the agreement, you suddenly change the agreement leaving the other party no choice, considering the efforts already made.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

There is a smell about the bottom building which we couldn’t determine. 28 euros for parking g for two nights was very expensive much better and after car park in top building. In bottom building car park there was someone sleeping in their car for at least the two nights we were there.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me.

Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.

They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel.

They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer.

They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me.

But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer. The real and only contract was the bill they just had printed upon our arrival (which of course had no signature of me). They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me.

We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.

We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.

So I mailed the hotel confused about only two guests, stating two children should be added and mentioning their birth dates. I got a reply that this was confirmed. But when we arrived, suddenly the children were seen as adults and I had to pay an additional 37%. When I showed them the email in which I asked if everything was OK and where I mentioned the birth dates, they dismissed it as being an incorrect answer. The real and only contract was the bill they just had printed upon our arrival (which of course had no signature of me). They should have informed me correctly when I emailed them about the weird confirmation. Then I would have had the option to accept or search another hotel. Now I was faced in the afternoon with this after a long journey and basically forced to accept, even though I had in writing they agreed on the first price. In my book, and I guess in anybodies book, when you make a mistake you fix it and bear the consequences. You don't let others bare the consequences of your mistake. They didn't even apologize. They were only waiving 'the contract'. This is a total no go for me. You don't agree on something, confirm it, and then when the other party has done some effort to come to the closure of the agreement, you suddenly change the agreement leaving the other party no choice, considering the efforts already made.

Pita, Carlos, Antonio!  I love wood floors in the bedrooms.  You know they are clean. The mattresses are excellent. Crisp white linen changed daily during our two week stay.  Clean!  We went to Andorra for the spa treatment.  The thermal waters are piped into the bathrooms. I soaked in the tub every night which was incredibly healing after the vein surgery on my leg which was what brought us to Andorra.  You could not find better masseuses anywhere.  Incredible attention to technique. We live in France and the hotel and spa were a fraction of the cost of treatment in France (not to mention the lack of medical practitioners to  help with rehabilitation). We don't typically eat in hotel  restaurants, but this was an exception.  As we arrived late the first day, we decided to try the dinner.  The chef was excellent. Amuse bouches to start, tapas portion. Subtle little sauces, delicate fish filets in a light but succulent sauce.  The first course pastas were scrumptious, warm bread from the oven, beautiful local white wine.  Forgot to mention our waiter/barman who made generous cocktails. Fantastic mojitos and juicy sangria.  We learned there must be a second chef who was good but not the same light touch.  You sleep like a baby in the high altitude air with the rushing river out  the window.  It is a magnificent torrent and loud!  But the windows are insulated.  Once you close them, you have complete silence.  The first week, we slept with the windows closed; second week, wide open.  The breakfast is copious with Spanish hams and other cold cuts, cheeses, fresh baked goods, fruits, fruit salads, health smoothies, eggs to order, country yogurt, chia blends...generous selection!

Moreover, later that day they gave the key card of our room to a new guest! We were laying on the bed relaxing after the hike when someone strange entered our room! If we were not there someone could have taken our staff and we would not be able to prove it. On top of that, every piece of furniture of the hotel and our room (with the exception of bed and towels) was dirty.", '3c7b4247-dc17-4866-8d85-a10ac22576cf', '2100586b-e897-47b3-a589-4af2497d189e', '2023-09-11 15:16:51.458765');
